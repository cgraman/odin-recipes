        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It's Wednesday and you want something extremely good for dinner, but you also don't want to spend your entire evening cooking and cleaning. We hear you and that's exactly why Arroz con Pollo is the perfect weeknight dinner and leftovers make fantastic lunches. It's an easy one pot meal that doesn't taste like one. The rice is so flavorful you'll be eating it straight out of pan and we won't blame you. If you'd rather use all chicken thighs instead of drumsticks go ahead and swap them out! </p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then season all over with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, combine cumin, oregano, garlic powder, and cayenne. Rub mixture into chicken. </li>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Add chicken and cook until golden, 5 minutes per side. Remove skillet and reserve on a plate.</li>
            <li>To same skillet over medium heat, add onion and pepper. Cook until soft, 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more, then stir in tomato paste.</li>
            <li>Add rice and cook until well coated and toasted, 3 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and diced tomatoes, and bay leaf, stirring up any bits from bottom of pan. Bring to a boil, then add chicken back to skillet. Reduce heat and let simmer, covered, until chicken is cooked through and rice is tender, 30 minutes. Stir occasionally to make sure rice is not sticking to bottom of pan. Add more water or broth as necessary.</li>
