        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Stuffed peppers hold a special place in our heart. From cheesesteak stuffed peppers to vegetarian stuffed peppers, this versatile veggie is one of our favorites to experiment with. Strong enough to hold their shape, peppers are large enough to hold a decent amount of filling while taking to a variety of flavors—they're the perfect vessel for a variety of fillings and ingredients.</p>
        <p>However, this classic recipe is hard to beat in our book. Here we’re filling them with beefy tomato rice and shredded Monterey Jack cheese, but you can customize them to fit your taste (and whatever you have in your refrigerator). Swap out the ground beef for another ground protein (pork, turkey, chicken, or even Italian sausage!) and add in any melty cheese you like.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ui>
            <li>1/2 c. uncooked rice</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. tomato paste</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>1 (14.5-oz.) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp. dried oregano</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>6 bell peppers, tops and cores removed</li>
            <li>1 c. shredded Monterey jack</li>
            <li>Freshly chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
        </ui>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400°. In a small saucepan, prepare rice according to package instructions. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Cook onion until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add ground beef and cook, breaking up meat with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, 6 minutes. Drain fat.</li>
            <li>Return beef mixture to skillet, then stir in cooked rice and diced tomatoes. Season with oregano, salt, and pepper. Let simmer until liquid has reduced slightly, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place peppers cut side-up in a 9"-x-13" baking dish and drizzle with oil. Spoon beef mixture into each pepper and top with Monterey jack, then cover baking dish with foil.</li>
            <li>Bake until peppers are tender, about 35 minutes. Uncover and bake until cheese is bubbly, 10 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Garnish with parsley before serving.</li>
        </ol>
